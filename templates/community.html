        <p class="community_pics_text">The Fuel Rats are a group of pilots who provide free aid to ships that have run out of fuel and have no means to refuel themselves due to either lacking a Fuel Scoop or having insufficient fuel to reach a star via hyperspace or supercruise.[1] They primarily use fuel transfer limpets to refuel these wayward ships, but they have also adopted repair limpets. They are represented by two minor factions: The Fuel Rats Mischief in Fuelum in the Core Systems, and The Fuel Rat Colony in Rodentia in the Colonia Region. &nbsp; The Fuel Rats are a hierarchy-less collective. That means they have no leader and no assigned jobs within the organization. Members who disagree about something work it out by listening to each other, suggesting solutions, and (hopefully) deciding collectively what to do. Not having leaders does not mean chaos; it is not the dog-eat-dog world of a nihilist/survivalist. "Our collective is more like the communes of the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Epicurus: they did not need government or leaders because they were basically in agreement about what needed to be done." The “collective” is more like a team, sharing a common goal. Military units have to resort to hierarchical command-structures in order to get people to do the right thing in a situation where disagreement is fostered by political pressure. The Fuel Rats prefer to expect people to do the right thing. If someone doesn’t fit in, they’ll get polite suggestions to find another hobby than Fuel Ratting.</p>

        <p class="community_pics_text">Operation Ida is an independent player group and Player Minor Faction that focuses on station repairs. Created in 3304 and headquartered in Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-41, Operation Ida was founded due to an overwhelming need to repair stations that were attacked by Thargoids in the Pleiades Nebula. Stations that are attacked by Thargoids or humans require specific commodities (anywhere from 200,000 to 2,500,000 tons) to bring the station back online. Operation Ida specializes in organizing mass repair efforts and coordinating thousand of haulers to bring commodities to stations with the goal of repairing the station and restoring its services. As of April 3307, Operation Ida has conducted 167 repair efforts in the Pleiades, Core Systems, Witch Head Nebula, and the Coalsack Nebula, and consists of 1,558 player haulers who have collectively hauled over 94 million tons of commodities.</p>
